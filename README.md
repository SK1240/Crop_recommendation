# 🌾 Crop Recommendation System
A smart **Machine Learning-powered** web app built using **Streamlit** and the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to recommend the most suitable crop for cultivation based on soil nutrients and environmental conditions.
> 🧩 **This project was successfully completed as part of my _Data Science Internship_, showcasing practical implementation of data-driven agriculture solutions.**

## 🚀 Tech Stack

* 🐍 Python — core programming language for logic, computation, and machine learning workflows.

* 📊 pandas, NumPy — for efficient data preprocessing, manipulation, and numerical analysis.

* 🤖 scikit-learn (KNN Model) — used for building and training the K-Nearest Neighbors classification model.

* 💾 Pickle — utilized for saving and loading the trained model (model.pkl) to enable fast, reusable predictions.

* 🌐 Streamlit — for developing an interactive and lightweight web application with real-time user inputs.
